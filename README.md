# ApocalypticCards
A game to alleviate boredom while under "stay-at-home" orders.

Developed during a series of live coding sessions which begand on March 28th 2020. *ongoing*
This Delphi powered game aims to ease the pain of being ordered by our overlords to remain at home.

NOTE: You do not have to wear a mask while coding but if you are sharing your keyboard
or screen you do need to stay six feet away from your computer peripherals.  We don't
have to ask you to practice social distancing - you're a coder, being socially distant
from The Normals is the default setting.
